# Crm-web Component Guideline

## Summary and Plans
Currently, I have extracted some of the story files of the storybook from crm-web and configured them separately.
It is an intermediate step to manage it as a repository to go to the monorepo format in the future.

## How to start dev environment
please install minimum version of node and npm.

- node version: `v16.19.0`
- npm version: `8.15.0`

```
npm i //install packages
npm run storybook //start app
```
